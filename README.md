# FADIP - FlexibleAnomalyDetectionIntegrationPlatform

This platform allows to use and evaluate different anomaly detection algorithms with timeseries from csv files or from 
Prometheus instances.

## Sample Stack for Testing the framework 

Can be found under /sample-stack. Provides a basic setup with Prometheus, Grafana, Node-Exporter, CADVisor. 

## Plug-Play Anomaly Detection Framework

Flex-ADF ( = Flexible Anomaly Detection Framework) is developed to provide a plug-play anomaly detection solution for Prometheus, Grafana by comparing, assessing, and using other known anomaly detection frameworks for time-series data.
